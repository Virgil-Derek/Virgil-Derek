Hello World, 
My name is Derek. 
I am sculpting my digital knowledge since 2021
My interests vary far: literature, music, history, science, technology, finance, economy, future,... So basically how the world works and how to navigate through the varieties of possible outcomes one has in life. 
By keeping my eyes open for opportunities, interesting endeavours, I hope to contribute something to somehting.
At night I fill up glasses, shake cocktails and try to manage a bar. 

See You on the inside, otherside insight. 
Bye
